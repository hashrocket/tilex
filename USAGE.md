# Usage

We love seeing forks of Today I Learned in production! Here's a basic guide
for customizing your own version of the site.

### Style

Feel free to get creative! The layout, colors, fonts, assets, and meta tags
we've chosen should only serve as a starting point.

### Attribution

Please link to Hashrocket somewhere on the main page! Today I Learned is an
open-source project, and support from the community helps inspire continued
development.

Here's an example of an easy way to link to us:

```elixir
# lib/tilex_web/templates/layout/app.html.eex

<div class="copy">
  Today I Learned is an open-source project by
  <a href="https://hashrocket.com">
    Hashrocket
  </a>. Check out the
  <a href="https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex">
    source code

    to make your own!
