This site was open-sourced as a window into our development process, as well as
to allow people to experiment with the site on their own and contribute to the
project.

We originally implemented Tilex as
[_hr-til_](https://github.com/hashrocket/hr-til), a Ruby on Rails app.

### Installation

If you are creating your own version of the site,
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository.

Then, install [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/),
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/),
[Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation), and PostgreSQL.

Next, follow these setup steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex
$ cd tilex
$ mix deps.get
$ mix ecto.setup
$ npm install --prefix assets
$ mix phx.server
```

If you'd like to skip the database seeds, run `mix ecto.create && mix
ecto.migrate` in place of `mix ecto.setup`.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

To serve the app at a different port, include the `PORT` environment
variable when starting the server:

```
$ PORT=4444 mix phx.server
```

To set environmental variables, copy the example file:

```
$ cp .env{.example,}
```

Set your environmental variables in the new file, and then source them:

```
$ source .env
```

### Authentication

Authentication is managed by Ueberauth and Google. See the
[ueberauth_google README](https://github.com/ueberauth/ueberauth_google)
and [Google Oauth 2 docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer) for
setup instructions. To allow users from a domain and/or comma separated whitelist, set those configurations in
your environment:

```
# .env

export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-key.apps.googleusercontent.com"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="yoursecret"
export HOSTED_DOMAIN="your-domain.com"
export GUEST_AUTHOR_WHITELIST="joedeveloper@otherdomain.com, suziedeveloper@freelancer.com"
```

Once set, visit [`localhost:4000/admin`](http://localhost:4000/admin) and log
in with an email address from your permitted domain.

Tilex creates a new user on the first authentication, and then finds that same
user on subsequent authentications.

### Testing

Wallaby relies on
[ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/); install
it via your method of choice.

Run the tests with:

```
$ mix test
```

### Deployment

Hashrocket's Tilex is deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). These are
Hashrocket's deployed instances:

- Staging: https://tilex-staging.herokuapp.com
- Production: https://til.hashrocket.com

This project contains Mix tasks to deploy our instances; use as follows:

```
$ mix deploy <environment>
```
