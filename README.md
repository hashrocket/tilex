This site was open-sourced in as a window into our development process, as well as
to allow people to experiment with the site on their own and contribute to the
project.

We originally implemented Tilex as [_hr-til_][hr-til], a Ruby on Rails app.

For updates, follow us on [Twitter][twitter] and subscribe to our monthly
[newsletter][newsletter].

### Installation

If you are creating your own version of the site, [fork][fork] the repository
and clone your fork:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_github>/tilex
$ cd tilex
```

Then, install [Erlang][erlang], [Elixir][elixir], Node, and PostgreSQL.
[asdf][asdf] can do this in a single command:

```shell
$ asdf install
```

We recommend installing [forego](https://github.com/ddollar/forego) to make loading the `.env` file painless when starting the server.
Another nice option for this is [direnv](https://direnv.net/)

```shell
$ curl -O https://bin.equinox.io/c/ekMN3bCZFUn/forego-stable-darwin-amd64.zip
$ unzip forego-stable-darwin-amd64.zip -d /usr/local/bin
```

Install dependencies and start the server:

```shell
$ cp .env{.example,}
$ mix deps.get
$ mix ecto.setup
$ npm install --prefix assets
$ npm run deploy --prefix ./assets
$ mix phx.digest
$ forego run mix phx.server
```

Want to start with an empty database? Skip the seeds by running `mix ecto.create && mix
ecto.migrate` in place of `mix ecto.setup`.

Now you can visit http://localhost:4000 from your browser.

To serve the application at a different port, include the `PORT` environment
variable when starting the server:

```shell
$ PORT=4444 mix phx.server
```

### Authentication

Authentication is managed by Ueberauth and Google. See the [ueberauth_google
README][ueberauth_google] and [Google Oauth 2 docs][oauth_google] for
instructions. To allow users from a domain and/or comma-separated allowlist,
set those configurations in your environment:

```shell
# .env

export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-key.apps.googleusercontent.com"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="yoursecret"
export HOSTED_DOMAIN="your-domain.com"
export GUEST_AUTHOR_ALLOWLIST="joedeveloper@otherdomain.com, suziedeveloper@freelancer.com"
```

Once set, visit http://localhost:4000/admin and log in with an email address
from your permitted domain.

Tilex creates a new user on the first authentication, and then finds that same
user on subsequent authentications.

### Testing

Wallaby relies on [ChromeDriver][chromedriver]; install it via your method of
choice.  Then, run tests with:

```shell
$ mix test
```

### Deployment

Tilex is deployed to Heroku.

Follow the official [Phoenix Heroku deployment guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/heroku.html) for setup instructions.

This project contains Mix tasks to deploy our instances; use as follows:

```shell
$ mix deploy <environment>
```
