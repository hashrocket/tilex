# Tilex - Today I Learned in Elixir

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hashrocket/tilex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hashrocket/tilex)

> Today I Learned is an open-source project by the team at
> [Hashrocket](https://hashrocket.com/) that catalogues the sharing &
> accumulation of knowledge as it happens day-to-day. Posts have a 200-word
> limit, and posting is open to any Rocketeer as well as select friends of the
> team. We hope you enjoy learning along with us.

This site was open-sourced as a window into our development process, as well as
to allow people to experiment with the site on their own and contribute to the
project.

We originally implemented Tilex as
[_hr-til_](https://github.com/hashrocket/hr-til), a Ruby on Rails app.

### Installation

If you are creating your own version of the site,
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository.

Then install the [Phoenix
Dependencies](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation) as well as
PostgreSQL.

Next, follow these setup steps (includes database seeds):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex
$ cd tilex
$ mix deps.get
$ mix ecto.setup
$ cd ./assets
$ npm install
$ cd ..
$ mix phx.server
```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

To serve the app at a different port, include the `PORT` environment
variable when starting the server:

```
$ PORT=4444 mix phx.server
```

To set environmental variables, copy the example file:

```
$ cp .env{.example,}
```

Then, set your variables and source them:

```
$ source .env
```

### Authentication

Authentication is managed by Omniauth and Google. See the
[omniauth-google-oauth2 README](https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2/blob/master/README.md)
and [Google Oauth 2 docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer) for
setup instructions. To allow users from a domain, set those configurations in
your environment:

```
# .env

export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-key.apps.googleusercontent.com"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="yoursecret"
export HOSTED_DOMAIN="your-domain.com"
```

Once set, visit [`localhost:4000/admin`](http://localhost:4000/admin) and log
in with an email address from your permitted domain.

Tilex creates a new user on the first authentication, and then finds that same
user on subsequent authentications.

### Testing

Wallaby relies on ChromeDriver; install it (OSX):

```
$ brew install chromedriver
```

Run the tests with:

```
$ mix test
```

### Deployment

These are the Tilex deployed instances:

- Staging: https://tilex-staging.herokuapp.com
- Production: https://til.hashrocket.com

Database migrations require telling Heroku how many pools to use. Here's an
example:

```
$ heroku run "POOL_SIZE=2 mix ecto.migrate"
```
